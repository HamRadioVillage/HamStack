# HamStack deployment profiles

HamStack roles describe **capabilities**. Profiles describe useful combinations
of those capabilities for recognizable machines.

Profiles are thin playbooks, not mega-roles. Operators can copy, edit, override,
or ignore them without changing the underlying role architecture.

## Development workstation

`playbooks/profiles/dev-workstation.yml` prepares an apt/Debian-family machine
for HamStack development. It expects an already-provided HamStack source tree
and intentionally has no IDE or Git-hosting opinion.

## Control station

`playbooks/profiles/control-station.yml` prepares the lead volunteer/operator
workstation that runs HamStack playbooks against conference infrastructure. It
contains controller dependencies, not shared service workloads.

## HamCube / central service node

`playbooks/profiles/hamcube.yml` expresses the current central service/display
pattern. Its baseline enables Gatus, CONHAM display, Blur Deck media service,
and a Chromium kiosk. Technitium DNS and OpenHamClock are opt-in profile
features. Every profile toggle is inventory-overridable; the profile supplies
default composition rather than a fixed appliance definition.

When the kiosk toggle is enabled (the default), set `hamstack_operator_user` to the
existing desktop login that should run Chromium. The profile does not create a desktop
session or configure display-manager autologin.

The profile is not tied to a literal HamCube. A Pi 5 with NVMe, a mini-PC, or a
suitable laptop may all fill the same architectural role.

## Running a profile locally

The profile host expression can be overridden. This is useful during initial
workstation bootstrap:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i 'localhost,' -c local \
  playbooks/profiles/control-station.yml \
  -e hamstack_profile_hosts=localhost \
  -e hamstack_operator_user="$USER" \
  -e hamstack_controller_user="$USER" \
  -e hamstack_controller_repo_path="$PWD" \
  --ask-become-pass
```

For normal inventory use, create groups such as `hamcube`, `control_station`, or
`dev_workstation` and run the profile without the host override. If the source tree
is not at the role default `~/hamstack`, set `hamstack_controller_repo_path` or
`hamstack_dev_repo_path` in inventory.

## HamCube profile toggles

The HamCube defaults can be changed in inventory without editing the profile:

```yaml
hamstack_profile_hamcube_gatus: true
hamstack_profile_hamcube_conham: true
hamstack_profile_hamcube_blur_deck: true
hamstack_profile_hamcube_kiosk: true
hamstack_profile_hamcube_technitium: false
hamstack_profile_hamcube_openhamclock: false

# Optional: point the kiosk at something other than local Gatus.
hamstack_profile_hamcube_kiosk_url: https://conham.hamstack.home.arpa/
```
